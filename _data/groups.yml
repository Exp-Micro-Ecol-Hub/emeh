    description: What makes some species prone to extinction? What determines the time when a species is likely to go extinct? What are the consequences of extinction for the remaining species? How will environmental change influence extinctions and their consequences? These and other questions about extinctions and environmental change provide the general motivation for our research. We use experiments with field and laboratory communities, mathematical modelling, and analyses of macro-scale datasets to ultimately provide an integrative understanding that spans from individuals up to ecosystems.

    description: With our work we want to understand how species occur in space and time, how they interact, and how processes such as species invasions, dispersal or climate change affect natural communities. Metapopulation and metacommunity theory provide a conceptual framework for our research. We use both an experimental and a comparative approach, and integrate them with theoretical models.
