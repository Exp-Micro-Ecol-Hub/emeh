        <h2>Species</h2>
        <p>Most of us work with bacteria, protists, and some small metazooans. Individuals of these species are very functionally diverse. They can reproduce, grow, die, attack, defend, parasitise, swim, crawl, slide, and lots more. This is one reason they're so interesting to study. Here are some websites with nice photos:

        <h2>Protocols</h2>
        <p>Protocols are in a <a href="https://github.com/opetchey/emeh-protocols"  target="_blank">github repository</a>. The protocols are a work in progress. Hopefully there will soon here be a link to a methods paper.</p>

        <p>Hopefully we can provide here a link to a large collection of relevant literature.</p>

        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>Experiments with microbes can be great for learning about population dynamics, interspecific interactions, coexistence, ecosystem process dynamics, and so on. We will happily provide teaching materials (i.e., instructions, and perhaps even some species) covering some of these topics.</p>
